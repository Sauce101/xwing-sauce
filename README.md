In this project I use Gatsby.js and styled components. I use a Star Wars type of feel just for getting ideas on how to mix patterns and thoughts that come to mind. I chose the X-wing Starfighter as a platform to divide into sections on one page. I puposefully left out any navbar or menu. Also this is my first time adding a video. The targeting computer section allows you to play and cast the video to a T.V.
